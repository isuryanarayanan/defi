Voting is a meticulous task to carry out, being wrong with even a singular process in the whole task would result in an unfair outcome. Voting steps include,
1. Validating eligible candidates and voters.
2. Making sure the voter and candidates are not recurrent.
3. Accepting votes anonymously.
4. Counting 1 vote as 1, and adding it to the right candidate.
